        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Founded in 1994 by a close-knit group of Japanese friends, RE&S was 
                born from one simple yet powerful dream: to bring the warmth, flavors, 
                and rich culinary traditions of Japan to Singapore. What started as a 
                humble vision quickly grew into a journey of dedication, creativity, and 
                a deep love for authentic Japanese cuisine.</p>
            <p>Today, every dish we serve is crafted with the same passion and attention 
                to detail that inspired our founders decades ago. From the freshest ingredients 
                to carefully perfected recipes, each meal is a celebration of Japan’s culture, 
                designed to offer our guests not just food, but an experience filled with flavor, 
                tradition, and heart.</p>
