# Design Process
I imagined this site to be visited by people of all ages and from any and every part of the world. I kept the fonts to be quite big for better readability, and chose font that are considered "dyslexic friendly" for those who struggle with dyslexia... 
I hope users who visit my site will be interested to drop by any outlets and give the foods a try, and hopefully leave with a good google review haha. I would also want users to be interetsed in working in this company, hence I talked about the background and growth to convinvce people we are a stable company.

As a job seeker, I would want to know the salary of the available roles. I would also want to know more about the company, to know if it is well-liked, have a stabe income to pay me, if there would be any bonuses, and how the community is like. Hence, I provided the range of pay checks (hiring section), its achivements (milestone sections), and the company's principles, or generally sharing information about them (mainly about us section). And I want to account for people who might have smaller screens or what not, that they still would get the best experience, and not face any challenges while navigating through my site.

I created wireframe on figma: https://www.figma.com/design/MxWDixHpWKrxq6I80Mlyjp/ID_10273775c_Edith_Assg1__wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=fD86wcV8Tu5RJubT-1
This guide me and helped me improve my designs. I would say they helped me by giving me a better idea on how to layout my code and all, like organising what should come first and get the idea of how to style it. I ended up improving on those ideas, so my website ended up being different from the figma prototype.
